# Guide for Building dApp GUIs and CLIs

This guide provides references for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or command-line interfaces (CLIs) for Solidity dApps.

## Python

You can use [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in Jupyter notebooks to create a dynamic and shareable GUI for your dApp.

You can also create CLIs by using Python libraries, like [Python Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)

## Remix

With [One Click Dapp](https://oneclickdapp.com/), you can build your smart contract for any network by using Remix.

## Pinata and IPFS

[Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/documentation), which is an API and an IPFS Gateway, is a splendid resource for storing and serving files, such as images for a dApp. It allows you to access files from a content delivery network (CDN) that resembles Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
