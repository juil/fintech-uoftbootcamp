## Generate Your Pinata API Keys

1. Go to the [Pinata website](https://pinata.cloud/).

    > **Important** The descriptions of the Pinata user interface reflect how it exists at the time of this writing. However, you might find slight differences because of updates.

2. Click the Sign Up button, and then sign up for a free account. If you already have an account, click the Login button, and then log in to the Pinata dashboard.

    > **Note** Pinata accounts are free and allow you to pin files up to a total of 1 gigabyte in IPFS.

3. Go to the [Pinata documentation page](https://pinata.cloud/documentation), and then follow the instructions to generate your Pinata API key and API secret key.

    > **Note** Make sure to click the option to grant Admin privileges for your keys.

## Optional: Install the IPFS Browser Extension

If you’d like the ability to display IPFS links directly in the browser in addition to displaying them on the Pinata website, you can install a web browser extension. With the extension, you’ll be able to connect directly to IPFS links.

To do this, go to the [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#install-ipfs-companion) GitHub repository, and then follow the installation steps for your browser.
