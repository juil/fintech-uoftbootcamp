# Portfolio Planner

This activity is a two-part mini-project where you will work in pairs to research a group of 10 stocks and perform an analysis of a $10,000 investment in the portfolio over time.

## Part 1: Portfolio Optimization via Risk Evaluation

Harold has been asked to research the following ten stocks:

* Bank of New York Mellon (BK)
* Diamondback Energy (FANG)
* Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
* Southwest Airlines Co (LUV)
* Micron Technologies (MU)
* Nike (NKE)
* Starbucks (SBUX)
* AT&T (T)
* Western Digital (WDC)
* Westrock (WRK)

Harold has been tasked with sorting stocks by risk/volatility, filtering out the top five stocks with the highest volatility and assigning the remaining stocks portfolio weights of 0.5, 0.2, 0.15, 0.10, and 0.05 (from least risk to most risk). He also needs to show the returns over time of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in such a portfolio.

Use the Pandas library to help Harold determine the risk profile of the 10 stocks, filtering out the top five highly volatile stocks, assigning portfolio weights to each corresponding stock, and plotting the returns of a $10,000 investment in such a portfolio over time.

### Instructions - Part 1

Using the starter file, complete the following steps:

1. Import libraries and dependencies.

2. Read in the following CSV files:

    * `bk_data.csv`
    * `fang_data.csv`
    * `jnj_data.csv`
    * `luv_data.csv`
    * `mu_data.csv`
    * `nke_data.csv`
    * `sbux_data.csv`
    * `t_data.csv`
    * `wdc_data.csv`
    * `wrk_data.csv`

3. Use `concat` to combine the DataFrames.

4. Use the `sort_index` function to sort the combined DataFrame by datetime index in ascending order (past to present).

5. Rename the columns to reflect the corresponding stock.

6. Use the `pct_change` function to calculate daily returns for each stock.

7. Use the `std` function and multiply by `np.sqrt(252)` to calculate annualized volatility. Use the `sort_values` function to sort by volatility values quickly.

8. Drop the five stocks with the highest volatility from the DataFrame of daily returns.

9. Set portfolio weights of 0.5, 0.2, 0.15, 0.10, and 0.05 to the remaining stocks (from least risk to most risk).

10. Use the `dot` function to multiply the weights by each column of daily returns to calculate the daily returns of the constructed portfolio.

11. Use the `cumprod` function to calculate the cumulative returns of the constructed portfolio.

12. Plot the returns of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the constructed portfolio.

### Hint

To plot the returns of a $10,000 investment, multiply the initial investment by the portfolio's cumulative returns over time.

## Part 2: Portfolio Optimization via Correlation and Return-to-Risk (Sharpe Ratio) Evaluations

Harold has been asked to revisit the 10 stocks that were researched in Part 1 of this activity.

Specifically, upper management wants Harold to go beyond just evaluating stocks by volatility/risk, and create a more optimized portfolio with the following characteristics:

* Equal-weighted allocations

* Only non-correlated stocks

* Only positive return-to-risk ratio stocks (Sharpe ratios)

Then, they want to visualize the returns of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in such a constructed portfolio over time, as well as how such a portfolio compares to 10,000 investments in less optimized portfolios.

Use the Pandas library to help Harold construct an optimized portfolio of stocks, and then plot and compare the returns of a 10,000 investment in the portfolio over time to less optimized portfolios.

### Instructions - Part 2

Using the starter file, complete the following steps:

1. Import libraries and dependencies.

2. Read in the provided CSV file containing the combined DataFrame created in Part 1.

3. Use the `pct_change` function to calculate and reassign a new DataFrame of daily returns.

4. Use the `corr` function and the `heatmap` function from the `Seaborn` library to calculate and visualize the stock return correlations for each stock pair.

5. Drop highly correlated stocks and keep only non-correlated stocks from the DataFrame (two stocks should be dropped).

    **Hint:** You can do this by visually identifying high correlations, or by summing then comparing total correlation values per stock.

6. Use the `mean` and `std` functions to calculate the annualized Sharpe ratio and assess the reward-to-risk ratio of the non-correlated stocks.

7. Drop stocks with negative Sharpe ratios from the DataFrame (three stocks should be dropped).

8. Assess the investment potential of a non-correlated (diversified) and return-to-risk (Sharpe ratio) optimized portfolio:

    * Set an equal weight for each stock in the optimized portfolio (five stocks). Use the `dot` function to multiply weights by each stock's daily returns to output the optimized portfolio's daily returns.

    * Calculate the optimized portfolio's cumulative returns, and then multiply the initial investment of $10,000 against the portfolio's series of cumulative returns. Plot the trend.

9. Assess the investment potential of a non-correlated (diversified) portfolio:

    * Set an equal weight for each stock in a non-correlated stock portfolio (eight stocks). Use the `dot` function to multiply weights by each stock's daily returns to output the non-correlated stock portfolio's daily returns.

    * Calculate the non-correlated stock portfolio's cumulative returns, and then multiply the initial investment of $10,000 against the portfolio's series of cumulative returns. Plot the trend.

10. Assess the investment potential of the original unoptimized portfolio:

    * Set an equal weight for each stock in an unoptimized portfolio (all 10 stocks). Use the `dot` function to multiply weights by each stock's daily returns to output the unoptimized portfolio's daily returns.

    * Calculate the unoptimized stock portfolio's cumulative returns, and then multiply the initial investment of `$10,000` against the portfolio's series of cumulative returns. Plot the trend.

11. Overlay the investment trend of every portfolio on a single chart, including the portfolio constructed in Part 1.

### Hint

Breathe easy! Take this activity one step at a time. Remember: this is the culminating activity of the Pandas lessons. Think about the bigger picture in terms of what makes a particular stock portfolio a good investment.
