# Column Manipulation of Pandas DataFrames

This is another basic exercise in which you will learn to manipulate the structure of a Pandas DataFrame, namely its columns. Often times, it is necessary to alter the structure of a Pandas DataFrame to fit the needs of the user.

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Import the `pandas`, `pathlib`, and `numpy` libraries (we'll need the numpy library in the following steps).

2. Create a variable `csvpath` that represents the path to the [people.csv](Resources/people.csv) using the Pathlib library.

3. Read the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame using the `csvpath` variable and display a few rows of the DataFrame.

4. View the column names of the Pandas DataFrame.

5. View the column data types of the Pandas DataFrame.

6. Using the `columns` attribute, rename the columns of the Pandas DataFrame to "Person_ID", "First_Name", "Last_Name", "Email", "Gender", "University", "Occupation", "Salary".

7. Alternatively, rename the columns of the Pandas DataFrame using a Dictionary.

8. Re-order the columns of the Pandas DataFrame to "Person_ID", "Last_Name", "First_Name", "Gender", "University", "Occupation", "Salary", "Email".

9. Create two additional columns: `Age` and `Age_Copy`. Use the `randint` function from the `numpy` library with the `low`, `high`, and `size` parameters set to `22`, `65`, and `1000`, respectively, to randomly generate an integer from 22 to 65 for 1000 rows.

10. Delete the newly created `Age_Copy` column.

11. Save the modified DataFrame to a new CSV, and put the file in the `Resources` folder.
