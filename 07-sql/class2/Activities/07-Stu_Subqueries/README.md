# Subqueries

In this activity, you will practice creating subqueries.

## Instructions

Use the [`payment`](Resources/payment.csv), [`customer`](Resources/customer.csv), [`staff`](Resources/staff.csv) and [`rental`](Resources/rental.csv) tables to answer the following subquery questions:

1. Find the customer first and last names of those who have made payments.

2. Find the staff email addresses of those who have helped customers make payments.

3. Find the rental records of all films that have been rented out and paid for.

## Bonus

Use the [`payment`](Resources/payment.csv), [`rental`](Resources/rental.csv), [`inventory`](Resources/inventory.csv), and [`film`](Resources/film.csv) tables to find the titles of all films that have been rented out and paid for.

**Hint:** You will need to use multiple nested subqueries.
