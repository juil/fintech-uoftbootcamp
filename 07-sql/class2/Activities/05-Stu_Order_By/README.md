# Payments Ordered By

In this activity, you will use `ORDER BY` in combination with other SQL methods to query and order the `payment` table.

## Instructions

1. Find the count of payments per customer in descending order.

2. Find the top 5 customers who have spent the most money.

3. Find the bottom 5 customers who have spent the least money.

4. Find the top 10 customers with the highest average payment rounded to two decimal places.

## Bonus

* Find the staff names and their number of customers serviced in descending order.

* Using the `CAST()` function, cast the `payment_date` as a DATE datatype to group by day (rather than date and time). Determine the count of payments per day in descending order.
