# User Prompts

In this activity, you will get more practice declaring and manipulating variables, using conditionals, and requesting user input.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/inputs-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Declare a variable `welcome_name` as an input with a string of "Welcome to the sandwich shop, what do I call you?"

2. Print the string "Hello" concatenated with the variable `welcome_name`.

3. Declare a variable `question_sandwich` as an input with a string of "Are you here for a sandwich? Yes or No?"

4. If `question_sandwich` is equal to true:

    * Declare a variable `food_prompt` as an input with a string of "What kind of sandwich would you like?"

    * Print a string of "Please wait 10 min for your " concatenated with the variable `food_prompt`.

    * If `question_sandwich` is false, print a string of "If you don't want a sandwich, what are you here for?!"
