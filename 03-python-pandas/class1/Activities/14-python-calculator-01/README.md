# Making a Calculator

This activity will combine everything we've covered today, along with some tools from yesterday. You will build a basic arithmetic calculator that takes in user input and returns the result of the calculation.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/python-calculator-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Define a function `calculate` that takes in two numbers and adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides the two numbers.

    * Create a variable `result` and set it to 0.

    * Prompt the user, "What do you want to do: Add, Subtract, Multiply or Divide?" Assign the answer to a variable `choice`.

    * Create an if-else statement to perform the proper calculation with the two parameters based on the user's `choice`.

    * Return the calculated `result` variable.

2. Call the `calculate` function and print the results.
