# Variable and Conditional Review

In this activity, you will review variable declaration and conditionals.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/condition-control-flow-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Create a list called `farm` with the elements "pig", "cow", "chicken", "dog", "horse", "sheep".

2. Write an if statement that prints the string "RWAR!" if the first element of `farm` is NOT "Godzilla".

3. Write an else-if statement that prints the string "SCREECH!" if the last element of `farm` is "Mothra".

4. Else, print the string "This animal is neither Godzilla nor Mothra!"

5. Declare a variable named `dog` with a string of "Spot".

6. Declare 3 variables, `cat`, `city`, and `car`, without assigning them values.

7. Assign the string "Farley" to `cat`.

8. Assign the string "San Francisco" to `city`.

9. Assign the string "Prius" to `car`.

10. Using string concatenation, print out the sentence "See Spot run!"

11. Using string concatenation, print out the sentence "I drive Farley around San Francisco in my Prius".

12. Declare a variable `budget` and assign it a value of 5000.

13. Declare a variable `rent_cost` and assign it a value of 1500.

14. Declare a variable `utilities_cost` and assign it a value of 150.

15. Declare a variable `food_cost` and assign it a value of 250.

16. Declare a variable `transportation_cost` and assign it a value of 350.

17. Declare a variable `computer_cost` and assign it a value of 2000.

18. Declare a variable `total_cost` that takes the sum of all costs above (excluding budget).

19. Write an if statement that checks whether the sum of all the costs is within the budget.

    * If so, print "Your total cost is " concatentated with the `total_cost` variable.

    * Else, print "You're over budget by " concatenated with the difference between `budget` and `total_cost`.

20. Write an if statement that checks whether the `rent_cost` is larger than the sum of the `utilities_cost`, `food_cost`, and `transportation_cost`.

    * If so, print a string that says "The rent is too damn high!"

    * Else, print a string that says "Ahhh just right!"
