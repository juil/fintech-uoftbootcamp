# More Practice with Variables and Logic Check

You will be getting more practice declaring and manipulating variables, and checking logic in this exercise.

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Declare a variable of `name` with an input and a string of "Welcome to the Boba Shop! What is your name?"

2. Check if `name` is not an empty string or equal to `None`.

    * If so, write a print statement with a string of "Hello" concatenated with the variable `name`.

    * Declare a variable of `beverage` with an input and a string of "What kind of boba drink would you like?"

    * Declare a variable of `sweetness_level` with an input and a string of "How sweet do you want your drink: 0, 50, 100, or 200?"

        * If `sweetness_level` equals 50, declare a variable `sweetness` as "half sweetened".

        * Else if `sweetness_level` equals 100, declare a variable `sweetness` as "normal sweet".

        * Else if `sweetness_level` equals 200, declare a variable `sweetness` as "super sweet".

        * Else, declare a variable `sweetness` with a string of "non-sweet".

    * Print the string of "Your order of " concatenated with the variable `beverage`, concatenated with " boba with a sweet level of ", concatenated with the variable `sweetness`.

3. Else, print the string of "You didn't give us your name! Goodbye".

**HINT:** Remember to cast your numerical values as `int()`
