# Getting Familiar with the Terminal

In this activity, we're going to be practicing a bit more with terminal commands.

## Solution

1. To start with, let's open up the terminal in this folder.

2. Let's see what's in the folder! Use the `ls` command to see the contents of this folder.

3. What's the current path we're in? Let's find out with the `pwd` command.

    **Note:** Notice that the path you're currently at is the folder where you right clicked to start git bash.

4. Make a new directory named `Activity-1` and then list the contents of the current directory again to make sure it worked.
