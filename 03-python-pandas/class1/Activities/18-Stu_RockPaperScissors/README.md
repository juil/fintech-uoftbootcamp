# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot

In this activity, you will create an RPS game that takes user input from the command line and plays against the computer.

## Instructions

1. Using the command line, take an input of `r`, `p`, or `s`, which stands for rock, paper, and scissors.

2. Have the computer randomly choose one of these three choices.

3. Compare the user's input to the computer's choice to determine if the user won, lost, or tied.

4. Remember to pseudo-code first!

## Hint

You can refer to this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306400/how-to-randomly-select-an-item-from-a-list) for help with performing random selections in Python.
