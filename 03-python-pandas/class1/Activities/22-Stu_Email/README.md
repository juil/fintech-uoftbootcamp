# Generating Email Addresses

In this activity, you will write a Python script to generate an email address using fields from a CSV file.

## Instructions

1. Use `csv.DictReader` to read the contents of a CSV file into a dictionary.

    * Use the `first_name` and `last_name` keys to create a new email address using the first and last name of the employee. For example, `{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Glenn"}` would generate the email: `john.glenn@example.com`.

    * Create a new dictionary that includes the `first_name`, `last_name`, `ssn`, and `email`.

    * Append the new dictionary to a list called `new_employee_data`.

2. Use `csv.DictWriter` to output the `new_employee_data` to a new CSV file.

## Hint

Refer to the documentation for [DictReader](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader).
