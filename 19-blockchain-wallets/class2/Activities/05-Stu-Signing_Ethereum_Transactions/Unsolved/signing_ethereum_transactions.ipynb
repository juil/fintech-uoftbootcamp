    "# Signing Ethereum Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will use the Web3.py library to sign and authorize messages using your public-private key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Complete each of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `Unsolved` folder, add the `.env` file that contains the mnemonic seed phrase that you generated in the first activity. Be sure to save this as the variable `MNEMONIC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Call `os.getenv(\"MNEMONIC\")` and save its value as a variable named `mnemonic`. Confirm that your seed phrase is available by checking the `type` of your `mnemonic` variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rewind** The information contained in an `.env` file should never be displayed to a program’s user. To confirm that the information is available, you can check the data type of the variable using the syntax `type(variable)`. If the variable has been imported correctly, the result should be a data type “str”, indicating that it is a string variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the bip44 package, generate a `Wallet` instance and pass your `mnemonic` variable as the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Derive public and private keys from your wallet instance; save the values as two variables named `public` and `private`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important** Remember that with the code we’re using today, generating a wallet with the same mnemonic seed phrase will generate the same private key and account information every time we run the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using the `Account` object and the `privateKeyToAccount` function, use your private key to generate an Ethereum account. To confirm the account was successfully initiated, print the account’s address.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a new string variable named `msg`, and set its value equal to any message you would like to sign&mdash;e.g., “Zach owes Glenna 40”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use `encode_defunct(text=msg)` from Web3.py to byte encode your message. Save the output as a variable named `encoded_msg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Call the `w3.eth.account.sign_message` method. Pass it your encoded message variable and your private key. Your private key will “sign” your new message. Save the returned signed message as a variable named `signed_message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Then, call the `w3.eth.account.recover_message` method. Pass it your encoded message variable and the message’s signature from the `signed_message.signature`. Confirm that the returned value matches the account address that was printed in Step 5. \n",
