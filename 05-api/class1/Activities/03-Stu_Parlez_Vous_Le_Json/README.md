# Parlez-vouz le JSON?

Now that you know that the below APIs are functioning, go back and run one of them again in order to get a closer look at the JSON data being returned. Capture your findings, and then turn and share your observations with a partner.

APIs

* Nasdaq -> https://data.nasdaq.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/GOOG.json

* World Bank -> http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?format=json

* Coinbase -> https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/buy?format=json

## Instructions

1. Quickly get into two-person teams.

2. Each member should choose one of the APIs above to execute in `Postman`.

3. Execute the API request and view the output in `JSON` format.

4. Read through the JSON. Try and make sense of a sub-section of the data (i.e. close date for a specific ticker, the Canada's 2021 GDP value, or current price of Bitcoin).

5. Turn and teach your partner about what you deciphered from the JSON data.
