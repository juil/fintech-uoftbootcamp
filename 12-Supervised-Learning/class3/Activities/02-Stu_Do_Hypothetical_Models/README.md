# Hypothetical Models

In this activity, you will weigh the pros and cons of using each evaluation metric for a set of hypothetical classification models.

## Instructions

For each of the following scenarios, think about a model that you might create to predict the outcome of interest. With a partner, discuss what is being predicted and which evaluation metrics are best for comparing the effectiveness of models.

1. A company wants to block phishing messages—predict whether an email is spam or not spam.

2. Doctors want an objective second opinion on imaging results—predict whether an MRI shows cancerous growth.

3. Farmers want improved weather forecasts—predict whether it will rain the next day.

4. A venture capital firm wants to optimise its investments—predict whether a company will undertake an IPO in the next 12 months.

## Hint

Think about the likelihood of each class (e.g., “Rain” or “No Rain”, or “SPAM” or “Not SPAM”) in addition to the costliness of false positives or negatives.
