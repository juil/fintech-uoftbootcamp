# Predicting Sales with Linear Regression

## Background

You and some friends have created the ultimate child seat. It's a light and resistant seat that can be folded and stored in a backpack—the perfect solution for families travelling with children or for people sharing their cars to take their kids to school.

You want to spread the word about your invention, so you've decided to run a digital marketing campaign using online ads. Now that you've run the campaign for a few days while displaying different ads per day, you want to create a model to predict the expected sales, depending on the number of ads you decide to show on the internet.

And, you have realised that this is an excellent opportunity to use your linear regression skills to create a prediction model.

## Instructions

Follow the steps to create a linear regression model to predict sales based on the historical data provided.

1. Load and visualise the sales data.

2. Prepare the data to fit the linear regression model.

3. Build the linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` module of scikit-learn.

4. Plot the best fit line for the sales prediction model.

5. Use the linear regression model to predict the sales with 100 ads.

6. Make predictions using the `predict` function of the `LinearRegression` module.

7. Use the original data (the `X` and `y` sets) to assess the linear regression model using the score, r2, mse, rmse, and standard deviation metrics.
