# Predicting Loan Default with Random Forests

In this activity, you will explore how to use random forest algorithms for identifying loans that are likely to default. You will use the `sba_loans_encoded.csv` file that you created before to train the model.

## Instructions

### Loading and Preprocessing Loans Encoded Data

1. Load the `sba_loans_encoded.csv` in a Pandas DataFrame called `df_loans`.

2. Define the features set by copying the `df_loans` DataFrame and dropping the `Default` column.

3. Create the target vector by assigning the values of the `Default` column from the `df_loans` DataFrame.

4. Split the data into training and testing sets.

5. Use the `StandardScaler` to scale the features data. Remember that you only scale the `X_train` and `X_testing` DataFrames.

### Fitting the Random Forest Model

6. Once you've scaled the data, create a random forest instance and train it with the training data (`X_train_scaled` and `y_train`), then define `n_estimators=500` and `random_state=78`.

### Making Predictions Using the Random Forest Model

7. Validate the trained model by predicting loan defaults using the testing data (`X_test_scaled`).

### Model Evaluation

8. Evaluate model's results by using `sklearn` to calculate the confusion matrix, the accuracy score, and the classification report.

### Feature Importance

9. In this section, you are asked to fetch the features' importance from the random forest model and display the top 10 most important features.

### Analysis Questions

10. Analyse the model's evaluation results and answer the following questions:

* **Question 1:** Would you trust this model as a loan default solution in a bank?

* **Question 2:** What are your insights about the top 10 most important features?
