# Predicting Fraudulent Loans Applications

## Background

Every year, banks and credit card companies lose billions of dollars due to compensating users whose identities are stolen for the purpose of creating fraudulent credit card applications. This is one reason why predicting fraud using machine learning techniques has become a [broad area of research](https://scholar.google.com.mx/scholar?q=fraud+detection+machine+learning&btnG=&oq=fraud+detection+) and a great [business opportunity for fintech startups](https://www.eu-startups.com/2019/06/paris-based-fintech-bleckwen-raises-e8-8-million-for-its-fraud-detection-software-to-prevent-financial-crime/).

In this activity, you will explore how to use tree-based algorithms for identifying fraudulent loan applications. You'll start by using a decision tree model that will be trained with the `sba_loans_encoded.csv` file that you created previously.

## Instructions

### Loading and Preprocessing Loans Encoded Data

1. Load the `sba_loans_encoded.csv` in a Pandas DataFrame called `df_loans`.

2. Define the features set by copying the `df_loans` DataFrame and dropping the `Default` column.

3. Create the target vector by assigning the values of the `Default` column from the `df_loans` DataFrame.

4. Split the data into training and testing sets.

5. Use the `StandardScaler` to scale the features data. Remember that you should scale only the `X_train` and `X_testing` DataFrames.

### Fitting the Decision Tree Model

6. Once data is scaled, create a decision tree instance and train it with the training data (`X_train_scaled` and `y_train`).

### Making Predictions Using the Tree Model

7. Validate the trained model by predicting fraudulent transactions using the testing data (`X_test_scaled`).

### Model Evaluation

8. Evaluate the model's results by using `sklearn` to calculate the confusion matrix and the accuracy score, and then generate the classification report.

### Visualizing the Decision Tree

9. Create a visual representation of the decision tree using `pydotplus`. Show the graph on the notebook, and also save it in `PDF` and `PNG` formats.

### Analysis Question

10. Analyse the model's evaluation results and answer the following question:

    Would you trust this model as a loan application approval solution in a bank?
