# Finding k

In this activity, you will use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters that should be used to segment a dataset of stock pricing information.

## Background

You have been analysing the pricing data on one of the stocks your firm owns. Specifically, you were examining the relationship between the day's trading volume and the spread between the high and low trading price.

Using the information contained in the starter file, use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, `k`, that should be used to segment these trades. Once the elbow curve has been established, evaluate the two most likely values for `k` using the K-means algorithm and a scatter plot.

## Instructions

1. Read in the `stock_data.csv` file from the Resources folder and create a DataFrame. Set the “date” column to create the DatetimeIndex. Be sure to include parameters for `parse_dates` and `infer_datetime_format`.

2. Scale the data by using the `StandardScaler` module to normalise the DataFrame values.

3. Create a new DataFrame with the scaled data and name it `spread_scaled_df`.

   > **Hint:** You can use the columns and index DataFrame's attributes to set the column names and the index of the new DataFrame. Review [this article from the Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html#attributes-and-underlying-data) if you want a refresher.

4. Create two lists: one to hold the list of inertia scores, and another for the range of k values (from 1 to 11) to analyse.

5. Using a `for` loop to evaluate each instance of k, define a K-means model, fit the K-means model based on the DataFrame, and append the model’s inertia to the empty inertia list that you created in the previous step.

6. Store the values for k and the inertia in a dictionary called `elbow_data`. Use `elbow_data` to create a Pandas DataFrame called `df_elbow`.

7. Using hvPlot, plot the `df_elbow` DataFrame to visualise the elbow curve.

8. Perform the following tasks for each of the two most likely values of `k`:

   * Define a K-means model by using `k` to define the clusters, fit the model, make predictions, and add the prediction values to a copy of the scaled DataFrame named `spread_predictions_df`.

   * Plot the clusters. The x-axis should reflect the "hi_low_spread", and the y-axis should reflect the "volume".

9. Answer the following question: Considering the plot, what’s the best number of clusters to choose, or value of k?
