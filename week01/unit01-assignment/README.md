**Origin:**  
Originally launched through the BoostVC accelerator in 2015 as a way to load a credit card with bitcoin and spend it in physical retail stores, Shakepay had to pivot quickly when their partner bank and VISA ended their partnership. The solution? Skip a couple steps in their business plan and launch a bitcoin exchange.

Now, 4 years after launching the Shakepay bitcoin exchange, the company has also released a digital VISA credit card that can spend the same $CAD in the account you use to purchase bitcoin, almost coming full circle to the founders' original vision.

**Industries:** Bitcoin, Fintech, Payments

## Business Activities:

### Problem Being Solved

#### Buying Bitcoin & Self-Custody
Shakepay as an exchange makes it as easy as possible to purchase bitcoin (and ethereum) and move it off the app to self-custody for Canadians.
* The exchange has no buy or sell fees but has a small trading margin for revenue while still maintaining prices at or very close to the market price.
* Canadians can instantly deposit and withdraw $CAD into their account using Interac e-transfers.
* Shakepay covers all transaction fees incurred when moving BTC off the app.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the ma
rket size of this set of customers?

offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing the

 they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imag
