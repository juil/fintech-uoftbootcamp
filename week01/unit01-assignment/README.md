**Origin:**  
Originally launched through the BoostVC accelerator in 2015 as a way to load a credit card with bitcoin and spend it in physical retail stores, Shakepay had to pivot quickly when their partner bank and VISA ended their partnership. The solution? Skip a couple steps in their business plan and launch a bitcoin exchange.

Now, 4 years after launching the Shakepay bitcoin exchange, the company has also released a digital VISA credit card that can spend the same $CAD in the account you use to purchase bitcoin, almost coming full circle to the founders' original vision.

**Industries:** Bitcoin, Fintech, Payments

## Business Activities:

### Problem Being Solved

#### Buying Bitcoin & Self-Custody
Shakepay as an exchange makes it as easy as possible to purchase bitcoin (and ethereum) and move it off the app to self-custody for Canadians.
* The exchange has no buy or sell fees but has a small trading margin for revenue while still maintaining prices at or very close to the market price.
* Canadians can instantly deposit and withdraw $CAD into their account using Interac e-transfers.
* Shakepay covers all transaction fees incurred when moving BTC off the app.

#### Spending Bitcoin in the Real World
There aren't many good ways to spend one's bitcoin in the real world unless a retail story intentionally goes through the trouble of setting up a custom terminal.
* The app has a digital prepaid VISA credit card that can be added to digital wallets (ex. Google Wallet, ApplePay) and then tapped in physical retail stores to pay for goods & services.
* Since the app is also an exchange, BTC and ETH can be sold anytime to top up the balance of the card.
* $CAD balance in the app earns 4% interest.

### Customer

#### Unfair Advantage
Because Shakepay only offers BTC and ETH, they are able to offer products with less regulatory scrutiny (SEC chair Gary Gensler confirms that [Bitcoin is not a security](https://decrypt.co/103926/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-not-security-what-about-ethereum), one of the only "crypto-currencies" to have such solid confirmation).

Being Canadian, Shakepay is able to integrate instant e-transfer of $CAD in and out of users' accounts. This also means that users do not have to rely on or pay fees for using other transaction methods like wire transfers.

Among its competitors, Shakepay is the only crypto app or CEX (centralized exchange) that offers:  
- unlimited no-fee withdrawals
- daily shake rewards ($sats)
- #shakepaid: a lottery-system that randomly refunds an entire Shakepay VISA purchase in sats

These are all loss-leaders, but Shakepay has garnered a very loyal base of **daily active users**, some of whome have accumulated millions in free sats.
