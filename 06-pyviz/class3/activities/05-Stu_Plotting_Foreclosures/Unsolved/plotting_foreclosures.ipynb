    "# Plotting Foreclosures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you’ll use GeoViews to visualize and explore real-estate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the `read_csv` function and the Path module, read `2018_Registered_Foreclosure_Properties.csv` from the `Resources` folder, and create the `la_foreclosures_2018` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Review the code that creates the `most_foreclosures_df` DataFrame from the `la_foreclosures_2018` DataFrame. The starter file provides this code. Be sure to run this cell as you work through the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >**Important** The [Pandas `isin` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isin.html) was used to filter the `la_foreclosures_2018` DataFrame based on a Python list that includes the five lenders with the most foreclosures: Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC; Wells Fargo Bank NA; JP Morgan Chase NA; and Nationstar Mortgage LLC.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the `points` function to plot the data from the `most_foreclosures_df` DataFrame. Include parameters as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the “Longitude” and “Latitude” columns in the DataFrame as your geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set `geo` equal to True to enable the GeoViews integration\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set `color` based on the “Lender” column.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set `tiles` to \"OSM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set `frame_width` to 700.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set `frame_height` to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Create a `title` for the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the `points` function to create a second plot from the `most_foreclosures_df` DataFrame. Keep all the parameters unchanged except as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set the `color` parameter to “Property Type”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Change the `title` parameter to correspond to the new information that you’re plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the `points` function to create a third plot from the `most_foreclosures_df` DataFrame. Keep all the parameters unchanged except as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set the `color` parameter to “Council District”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Change the `title` parameter to correspond to the new information that you’re plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Answer the following questions in the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * After reviewing the visualizations, what insights can you gain about the foreclosures in Los Angeles in 2018?\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Which lender owns the most foreclosed properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Do the lenders tend to focus on one area or council district in the city, or do they evenly distribute their properties throughout the region?\n",
