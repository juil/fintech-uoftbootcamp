# Picture Perfect

It's time to put some finishing touches to your masterpiece to make it picture perfect. Using the customization attributes and options demonstrated by the instructor, curate your visualizations. Make sure to assess each plot for aesthetic improvement opportunities.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/Core/picture_perfect.ipynb). The code to generate multiple plots is provided, your job is to assess them and make improvements as follows:

1. Use the `rot` function to make the x axis more legible.

2. Use the  `opts(yformatter=)` option to format y axis labels.

3. Add a title to all of your visualizations.

4. Increase the height or width of any plots that have rendered too small.

If you complete the activity early, continue on to the optional challenge section.

### Challenge

hvPlot also offers color customization. Follow the below steps to add additional customizations.

1. Change the background color of a plot using `opts(bgcolor=)` option.

2. Use the `opts(hover_line_color=)` option to change the color of a line or bar when hovering.

3. Change the color of a line chart or the outline of each bar in a bar chart using the `opts(line_color=)` option.

### Hint

The `opts` function can be used customize composite plot (i.e `(plot_state_avgs * plot_2015_2016 * plot_2010_2014).opts(width=900)`)

The [hvPlot documentation](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/user_guide/Customization.html) can be referenced for additional details regarding options and how they work.
