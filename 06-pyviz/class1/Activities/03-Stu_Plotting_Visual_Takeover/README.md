# Plotting a Visual Takeover

Your company has recently adopted a new digital dashboard initiative aiming to convert all existing company reports to reports that include interactive hvPlot visualizations. The CIO firmly believes that adding interactive visualizations will help users of the report glean more insight from the data they're working with.

The CIO also believes the company is falling behind in terms of reporting paradigms; while there are new and flashy visualization technologies out there, the company has mostly been using Matplotlib. It's time for an upgrade.

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/plotting_visual_takeover.ipynb) and code the following steps. The visualizations created below should use the starter data provided in the notebook.

## Instructions

1. Create an hvplot visualization without specifying a line or bar chart.

2. Create an hvplot line chart using the `hvplot.line` attribute.

3. Create an hvplot bar chart using the `hvplot.bar` attribute.

4. Create two hvplot scatter charts: One that uses the `hvplot.scatter` attribute and one that uses the `kind` parameter set to **scatter**.
