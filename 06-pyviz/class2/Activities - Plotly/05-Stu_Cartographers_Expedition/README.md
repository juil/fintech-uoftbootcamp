# A Cartographer's Expedition

Harold's birthday is right around the corner! For the New York City trip, Harold has made a demand: No one is allowed to bring their cellphones. Harold wants everyone present and in the moment, undistracted by technology.

Everyone's complaining at the thought of trekking around the big city without a GPS, but Harold is unrelenting. He wants to do this trip old-school style. Thinking about it, you realize that using an actual map might be pretty cool.

Instead of spending money on a NYC mapbook, become a true, modern cartographer and create interactive map plots that can be used by you and your friends to get the layout of the city.

Work in teams of two or three people to:

1. Identify six to eight locations to visit.

2. Use Plotly Express and Mapbox to plot 3 routes for the expedition.

3. Each route will hold 2-4 locations.

### Instructions

1. Set the Mapbox API key using the os.getenv function.

2. Read in the `harold_bday_plans.csv` data file.

2. Plot the data for **Route 1** by slicing the DataFrame for your **arriving airport** and the **first** set of locations the group will visit.

3. Now plot **Route 2** with the the **second** set of locations. Continue to plot the courses until you've included six to eight locations in three plots.

4. Finally, create a map with all locations plotted together.

### Challenge

If there are places in NYC that you'd like to visit and you know their geospatial details (latitude and longitude), feel free to add them to the data file. Be careful not to corrupt the data file.

If you do corrupt the file, re-download the data from Git and start again.
