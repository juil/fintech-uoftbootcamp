# Plotting with Plotly

Congratulations! You've been invited to the second round of the REMAX interview process for the data analyst role in the Business Intelligence department.

The interviewers are satisfied with your skills in **hvPlot**, and now want to better understand your competency by using **Plotly Express**. REMAX uses the **Plotly** platform, so the team wants to confirm that you are a good fit for their current development ecosystem.

Using **Plotly Express** and the provided real estate data, correlate the Pennsylvania Allegheny County sales data with foreclosures. Your goal is to demonstrate your understanding of real estate reporting requirements as well as your ability to develop visualizations that tell stories through data, especially relative to market targeting.

Complete this activity successfully, and you'll continue on to the next phase of the interview process!

## Instructions

1. Read in the Allegheny housing foreclosure data.

2. Slice the foreclosure data for Series **municipality** and **amount**.

3. Group data by **index.year** and **municipality**, and then perform a `count`. Hint: This will require a **DateTimeIndex**.

4. Create a **scatter** plot. The plot should resemble the screenshot below. Make sure to specify the appropriate `x` and `y` axes for a **scatter** plot.

5. Plot the relationship between the filing date and municipality using a **scatter** plot. The plot should resemble the screenshot below.

### Challenge

Plot the progression of foreclosures using an area chart to determine if the rate of foreclosures has increased or decreased over the years. Make sure to specify a Series for the `colour` and `line_group` attributes.

### Hint

Creating an **area** plot can be done using the Plotly Express [`area` function](https://plotly.com/python/filled-area-plots).
