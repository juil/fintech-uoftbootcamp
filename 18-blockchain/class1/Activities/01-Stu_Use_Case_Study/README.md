# Use Case Study

In this activity, you will examine several cryptocurrency and blockchain use cases and curate a list of blockchain features that apply to each use case.

The key features of a blockchain are:

* Decentralization

* Distributed architecture

* Trust

* Record keeping

* Transparency

## Instructions

1. Form groups of three or four people.

2. From the following Use Case Links section, choose a use case to read about for a few minutes. (Every member of the group should do this.) While reading, make a list of the features and functionality that you notice.

3. Compare the lists that each group member came up with. Discuss similarities and differences. Based on this discussion, compile a core set of features shared by all of the use cases.
