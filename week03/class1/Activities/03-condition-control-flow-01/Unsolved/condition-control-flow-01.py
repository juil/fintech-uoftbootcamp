# Create a list called 'farm' with the elements "pig", "cow", "chicken", "dog", "horse", "sheep".


# Write an if statement that prints the string "RWAR!" if the first element of farm is NOT "Godzilla".

# Write an else if statement that prints the string "SCREECH!" if the last element of farm is "Mothra".

# Else, print the string "This animal is neither Godzilla nor Mothra!".


# Declare a variable named 'dog' with a string of "Spot".

# Declare 3 variables `cat`, `city`, `car` without assigning them values.


# Assign the string "Farley" to `cat`.


# Assign the string "San Francisco" to `city`.


# Assign the string "Prius" to `car`.


# Using string concatenation, print out the sentence "See Spot run!".


# Using string concatenation, print out the sentence "I drive Farley around San Francisco in my Prius".


# Declare a variable budget and assign it a value of 5000.


# Declare a variable rent_cost and assign it a value of 1500.


# Declare a variable utilities_cost and assign it a value of 150.


# Declare a variable food_cost and assign it a value of 250.


# Declare a variable transportation_cost and assign it a value of 350.


# Declare a variable computer_cost and assign it a value of 2000.


# Declare a variable called total_cost that takes the sum of all costs above (excluding budget).


# Write an if statement that checks whether the sum of all our costs is within the budget.
# If so, print "You're total cost is " concatentated with the `total_cost` variable.
# Else, print "You're over budget by " concatenated with the difference between `budget` and `total_cost`.


# Write an if statement that checks whether the rent_cost is larger than the sum of the `utilities_cost`, `food_cost`,
# and `transportation_cost`. If so, print a string that says "The rent is too damn high!".
# Else, print a string that says "Ahhh just right!"
