# Loops

In this activity, you will get more practice with lists and loops.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/loops-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Declare an empty list named `our_list`.

2. Use the `append` list function to append the number 1 into `our_list`.

3. Append the string "hello" into `our_list`.

4. Append the Boolean "False" into `our_list`.

5. Append the number 84 into `our_list`.

6. Append the string "world" into `our_list`.

7. Print `our_list`.

8. Declare a variable named `one_to_ten` and assign it a list containing the numbers from 1 to 10.

9. Print the 4th element from `one_to_ten`.

10. Print the 7th element from `one_to_ten`.

11. Iterate through the provided `num_list` and create an if-else statement to print every number greater than 50.

12. Iterate through the provided `num_list` and use the `index` function to print the index of the first occurrence of the number 11.

13. Iterate through the provided `num_list` and print the sum of all the numbers.

14. Iterate through the provided `num_list` and create an if-else statement to print the sum of all the numbers greater than 50.

15. Iterate through the provided `num_list` and create an if-else statement to print the sum of all the even numbers.

16. Iterate through the provided `fruits` list and print the number of times "Apple" appears in the list.

17. Iterate through the provided `fruits` list and print the number of times "Peach" appears in the list.

18. Iterate through the provided `fruits` list and print the number of fruits that start with "P" in the list.

19. Execute the Python program.

    * Open the command line.

    * Run `source activate PythonData` to activate your virtual environment.

    * Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill.

    * Run `python filename.py` to test your output.

## Challenge

1. Create a new, empty list named `unique_fruits`.

2. Iterate through `fruits` and populate `unique_fruits` with only unique values from `fruits`. **Hint:** Look up "not in" conditionals for if statements.

3. Print out the `unique_fruits` list.

4. Iterate through the 1st list inside the provided `two_dim_list` and print all the numbers less than 25.

5. Iterate through the 2nd list inside `two_dim_list` and print all the numbers less than 25.

6. Iterate through the 5th list inside `two_dim_list` and print all the numbers less than 25.

7. Iterate through `two_dim_list` and the lists inside of it, and print all the odd numbers.

8. Iterate through `two_dim_list` and the lists inside of it, and print the sum of all the numbers that are a multiple of 3.
