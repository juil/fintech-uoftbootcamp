# Declare an empty list named `our_list`.


# Use the `append` list function to append the number 1 into `our_list`.


# Append the string "hello" into `our_list`.


# Append the boolean False into `our_list`.


# Append the number 84 into `our_list`.


# Append the string "world" into `our_list`


# Print `our_list`


# Declare a variable named `one_to_ten` and assign it a list containing the numbers from 1 to 10.


# Print the 4th element from `one_to_ten`.


# Print the 7th element from `one_to_ten`.


# We've declared this list for you

# Iterate through the provided `num_list` and create an if-else statement to print every number greater than 50


# Iterate through the provided `num_list` and use the `index` function to print the index of the first occurrence of the number 11.


# Iterate through the provided `num_list` and print the sum of all the numbers.


# Iterate through the provided `num_list` and create an if-else statement to print the sum of all the numbers greater than 50.


# Iterate through the provided `num_list` and create an if-else statement to print the sum of all the even numbers.

# Iterate through the provided `fruits` list and print the number of times "Apple" appears in the list.


# Iterate through the provided `fruits` list and print the number of times "Peach" appears in the list.


# Iterate through the provided `fruits` list and print the number of fruits that start with "P" in the list.


## Challenge

# Create a new empty list named `unique_fruits`.


# Iterate through `fruits` and populate `unique_fruits` with only unique values from `fruits`. Hint: try looking up "not in" conditionals for if statements


# Print out the `unique_fruits` list.


# In this challenge we're going to be working with nested lists.
# You can store any type of data within an list- even other lists!

  [55, 12, 2, 34, 2],
  [2, 12, 44, 2, 12]]

# Iterate through the first list inside `two_dim_list` and print all the numbers less than 25.


# Iterate through the second list inside `two_dim_list` and print all the numbers less than 25.


# Iterate through the fifth list inside `two_dim_list` and print all the numbers less than 25.



# Iterate through `two_dim_list` and the lists inside of it and print all the odd numbers.


# Iterate through `two_dim_list` and the lists inside of it and print the sum of all the numbers that are a multiple of 3.
