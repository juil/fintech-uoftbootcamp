# Kid in a Candy Store

In this activity, you will create the code a candy store will use in their state-of-the-art candy vending machine!

## Instructions

1. Create a loop that prints all of the candy in the store to the command line, with their index stored in brackets beside them, e.g., `"[0] Snickers"`

2. Create a second loop that runs for a set number of times as determined by the variable `allowance`.

  * For example, if `allowance` is equal to 5, the loop should run 5 times.

  * Each time this loop runs, take in a user's input––preferably a number––and then add the candy with a matching index to the variable `candy_cart`.

  * For example, if the user enters "0" as their input, "Snickers" should be added into the `candy_cart` list.

3. Create a final loop to print all of the candy selected to the command line.

## Challenge

Create a version of the same code that allows a user to select as much candy as they want, up until they say they do not want any more.
