# Number Chain

In this activity, you will "chain up the numbers."

## Instructions

1. Using a while loop, ask the user "How many numbers?" and then print out a chain of ascending numbers starting at 0.

2. After the results have printed, ask the user if they would like to continue.

  * If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.

  * If "n", exit the chain.

## Challenge

Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.
