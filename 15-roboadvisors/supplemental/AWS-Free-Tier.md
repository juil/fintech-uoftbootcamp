# Amazon Web Services Free Tier

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has three types of offers on its free tier:

* Free Trials

* 12 Months Free

* Always Free

The offer type that’s available depends on the product that you choose. For details about each free offer, refer to [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/).

The following table describes the AWS free offers for the services that we’ll use in this module:

The activities in this module use services that either exist on the free tier or cost less than five dollars total.

**Important:** To avoid additional charges, remember to delete the AWS resources that you create in this module&mdash;either after using them or by the end of the module. Follow the instructor's directions, because AWS constantly updates its offers and pricing policies. It’s also a good idea to check the latest terms on the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/) site.
