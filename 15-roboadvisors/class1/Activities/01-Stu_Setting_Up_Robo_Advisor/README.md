# Setting Up a Bitcoin Fear & Greed Robo Advisor

In this activity, you’ll set up a chatbot that will advise users about whether to invest in Bitcoin. The chatbot will base the advice on the [Fear & Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) that the Alternative.me crypto API provides.

## Background

Nowadays, Bitcoin is gaining the attention of people who’ve never bought or invested in it before. But, most of these people feel sceptical about it or afraid of losing their money.

The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index offers a mechanism for assessing how the market feels about this cryptocurrency. Although it doesn’t offer professional investment advice, it does offer some insights into the wisdom of buying or investing in bitcoins.

This index uses information from various sources, such as social media, surveys, Google Trends data, coin volatility, coin dominance, and coin volume (that is, the total amount of that coin traded in a day).

In this index, a value of 0 represents extreme fear, and a value of 100 represents extreme greed.

## Instructions
