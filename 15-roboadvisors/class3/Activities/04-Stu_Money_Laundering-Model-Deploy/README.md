# Preventing Money Laundering with Amazon SageMaker - Model Deployment

In this activity, you'll use the data that you prepared in an earlier activity to train a machine learning model in the cloud. Specifically, you’ll train it to predict whether a cash or transfer bank transaction is potentially money laundering fraud. To do so, you'll use Amazon SageMaker Studio and the SageMaker linear learner algorithm.

## Instructions

1. Note that you’re working in groups of two or three. Choose one person in the group to share their screen.

2. Open SageMaker Studio, and then upload the provided `predicting_money_laundering.ipynb` notebook.

3. As a group, go through each cell of code on the shared screen, inspecting and discussing the code. For each cell, add any missing code, and then run the cell.
