# Preventing Money Laundering with Amazon SageMaker - Data Preparation

In this activity, you'll gain practical experience with using Amazon SageMaker Studio to prepare the data for a machine learning application. This application will predict whether a cash or transfer bank transaction is potentially money laundering fraud.

## Background

Money laundering is a major problem that financial institutions face worldwide. The scale of money laundering is difficult to assess but is considered significant. The [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) estimates that from 2% to 5% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) gets laundered each year. That’s from $850 billion to $2.22 trillion dollars each year.

Machine learning offers a powerful solution for identifying anomalous activity on bank transactions that might lead to a money-laundering criminal operation.

In this activity, you’ll use computer-generated data that’s based on real-world bank transactions to prepare the data that will fit a machine learning model to help fight this crime. You’ll use SageMaker Studio to do so.

## Instructions

1. Note that you’re working in groups of two or three. Choose one person in the group to share their screen.

2. Open SageMaker Studio, and then upload the provided `predicting_money_laundering.ipynb` notebook.

3. As a group, go through each cell of code on the shared screen, inspecting and discussing the code. For each cell, add any missing code, and then run the cell.
