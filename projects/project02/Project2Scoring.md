-   Trained models are evaluated by using the testing data, and calculations, metrics, or visualisations that are needed to evaluate the performance are included. (10 points)

-   Predictions are provided by using a sample of new data, and the predictions are compared if more than one model was used. (3 points)

-   Visualizations in the form of PNG files are saved for two purposes: to distribute to the class and the instructional team and to include in your presentation and the `README.md` file for your repo. (2 points)

-   One new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric is used that the class hasn't already covered. (10 points)

#### Documentation (15 points)

-   Code is well commented with concise, relevant notes. (5 points)

-   GitHub `README.md` file includes a concise project overview. (2 points)

    -   Discuss any unanticipated insights or problems that arose and how you resolved them.

-   The results and conclusions from the machine learning model or application. (5 points)

    -   If the project goal wasn't achieved, share the issues and what the group tried for resolving them.

-   Next steps. (2 points)

    -   Discuss the potential next steps for the project.

    -   Discuss any additional questions that you'd explore if you had more time. Specifically, if you had additional weeks to work on your project, what would you research next?
