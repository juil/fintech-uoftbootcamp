# Blockchain-based Ticketing System App

<br>

## Project Brief: 
Overview of the Blockchain-Based Ticketing System App

A digital solution that makes use of blockchain technology to offer a ticketing platform that is both secure and transparent is the app for the blockchain-based ticketing system. Event organizers and attendees can manage and purchase tickets through the secure and user-friendly platform provided by the app. The app uses blockchain technology to make sure that all transactions are safe and can't be changed, so there's no risk of tickets being fake or stolen.

<br>

## Objectives: 
This project aims to create an app for a ticketing system based on the blockchain that can serve as a secure and transparent ticketing platform. Event attendees should be able to purchase and manage their tickets, and event organizers should be able to create events and tickets using the app. A safe payment gateway and a user-friendly interface for event organizers and attendees should also be included in the app.

<br>

## Features: 

The features of the blockchain-based ticketing system app will include:

* Creating an Event: Events can be created and ticket prices, dates, and other details can be set by event organizers.
* Ticket generation: The app will create one-of-a-kind digital tickets that will be saved on the blockchain and cannot be altered or duplicated.
* Sales of Tickets: Tickets can be purchased by attendees using a safe payment gateway through the app.
* Ticket Administration: The app lets attendees manage their tickets, including selling or transferring them to others.
* Blockchain Check: The app will check the ticket's blockchain record to see if it has been duplicated or altered to determine its authenticity.
