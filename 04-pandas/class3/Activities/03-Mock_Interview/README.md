# Mock Interview - Crack the Code

Suppose a you are trying to decrypt a message that was encrypted with a very simple mechanism where after the first letter, in between every letter of the message a random letter is placed. 

For instance the message could be this:

['CodingisCool']

And the encrypted message would be this:

['CxowdwidnfgcisswCgohojlk']

Write a function that receives an encrypted string and prints the original message.

## Notes to the Interviewee

* Create a blank notebook to code your solutions for the class.

* Review the solution ahead of time.

* Remember: Assume that your coding skills are at a similar level as those of the students. 

* Throughout the interview, pretend that you have a general idea of how to proceed but cannot come up with the solution right off the bat. Rely on promts from the instructor for most of the steps. The goal of this exercise is for students to get comfortable with not knowing how to proceed but continue to think of ways to solve the problem.

## Potential Prompts for the Interviewer

The interviewer should use this illustration to show how the prompts need to be carefully balanced to allow for enough time to test the candidate's problem solving skills but also not get stuck in individual sections.

## Structure

This structure doesn't need to be adhered to precisely but is just a general guideline.

1) Have the interviewee begin by restating the problem to ensure they understood it correctly.

2) Sketch the solution: The interviewee should first express how it might make sense to find a way to print out every letter in the message and then filter out the letters that were placed in between in the next step to get the actual message.

3) Coding the solution: Follow the approach outlined in the notebook
