# Reading a CSV as a Pandas DataFrame

This is a basic exercise and serves as the foundation for many Pandas programs, in which data (in some form) is read into a DataFrame; the data being read in this case is a standard CSV file.

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Import the `pandas` and `pathlib` libraries.

2. Create a variable `csvpath` that represents the path to the [people.csv](Resources/people.csv) using the Pathlib library.

3. Read the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame using the `csvpath` variable.

4. Display a few rows of the DataFrame.

5. Generate summary statistics on the DataFrame. Use the `include` parameter and set it to `all`.
