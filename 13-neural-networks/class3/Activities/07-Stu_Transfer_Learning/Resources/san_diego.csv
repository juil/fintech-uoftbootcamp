Larger lots typically uncharacteristic of the beach grace palm tree-lined streets with sounds and views of the ocean throughout.\xa0Visitors from all over the world pay special attention to Camino de la Costa known locally as the ""Street of Dreams"" where stunning estates with spectacular curb appeal sit just feet from the water.\xa0Homes in Lower Hermosa become available on average just every 14 years.\xa0   Windansea Beach commonly referred to as \Windan\ is a .8 mile stretch of coastline discretely located between the buzzing neighborhoods of Bird Rock and The Village. Unlike its tourist-heavy counterparts you won\t find large parking lots waterfront retail or surfboard rentals at Windansea. Instead you\ll find a quiet enclave of sand and clay rock formations that ease into an eclectic range of swimming surfing and play zones where locals of all ages prefer to spend their summer days.   During spring time each year a fresh slab of sand washes ashore to cover Windansea\s iconic clay rock formations. Clean and thick-grained sand remains throughout summer when the water temperature is perfect for swimming. In the fall larger waves and changing currents wash most of the sand away revealing the rocks once again. This natural cycle is the cornerstone of Windansea\s refreshing aesthetic.

The main home offers five bedrooms one of which is furnished as a den. There is additionally one separate guest suite above the 2-car detached garage. The flat 10333 square foot lot is gated and private with ample space to play including an in-ground trampoline outdoor TV area and wifi integrated outdoor sound system.  Situated south of iconic Windansea Beach north of Bird Rock and west of La Jolla Blvd Lower Hermosa is one of the most exclusive and sought-after luxury coastal neighborhoods in all of Southern California.\xa0   Established in the 1920\s Lower Hermosa has an old world feel with diverse architecture ranging from classic Spanish to contemporary. Larger lots typically uncharacteristic of the beach grace palm tree-lined streets with sounds and views of the ocean throughout.\xa0Visitors from all over the world pay special attention to Camino de la Costa known locally as the ""Street of Dreams"" where stunning estates with spectacular curb appeal sit just feet from the water.\xa0Homes in Lower Hermosa become available on average just every 14 years.\xa0   Windansea Beach commonly referred to as \Windan\ is a .8 mile stretch of coastline discretely located between the buzzing neighborhoods of Bird Rock and The Village. Unlike its tourist-heavy counterparts you won\t find large parking lots waterfront retail or surfboard rentals at Windansea. Instead you\ll find a quiet enclave of sand and clay rock formations that ease into an eclectic range of swimming surfing and play zones where locals of all ages prefer to spend their summer days.   During spring time each year a fresh slab of sand washes ashore to cover Windansea\s iconic clay rock formations. Clean and thick-grained sand remains throughout summer when the water temperature is perfect for swimming. In the fall larger waves and changing currents wash most of the sand away revealing the rocks once again. This natural cycle is the cornerstone of Windansea\s refreshing aesthetic.
