# Preventing Credit Card Defaults, Part 2

In this activity, you will continue working on the neural network model to prevent credit card defaults. Here, you will compile, fit, and evaluate the model.

## Instructions

1. Open the notebook and run all the cells in the Jupyter notebook that correspond to “Preventing Credit Card Defaults Part 1”.

2. Compile the neural network model using the `binary_crossentropy` loss function, the `adam` optimiser, and the additional metric `accuracy`.

3. Fit the model with the training data for 100 epochs.

4. Plot the model’s loss function and accuracy over the 100 epochs.

5. Evaluate the model using testing data and the `evaluate` method.
