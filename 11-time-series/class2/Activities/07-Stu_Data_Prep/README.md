# Assessing Market Opportunities for Alpaca Wool Scarves: Data Preparation

In this scenario, you are collaborating with the International Co-operative Alliance. The goal is to validate market opportunities for the Aymara indigenous people in Bolivia to export alpaca wool scarves to different countries or regions.

You’ll prepare the data for time series forecasting to analyse Google Trends data. Later, you will use Prophet to validate prospective market opportunities.

## Instructions

1. Open Google Colab and import the provided starter notebook.

2. Read the Google Trends data into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Plot the general trends.

4. Prepare the data to fit the Prophet model. Create two new DataFrames: one for Canada and another for Uruguay. Remember to set the column names to “ds” for the dates and “y” for the trend values.

   **Hint:** You can use the [Pandas rename function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html) to set the column names as requested.
