# Visualising Stock Data

In this activity, you explore your time series dataset by creating visualisations of the data.

## Background

As you analyse Tesla Motor's stock, you decide to investigate how TSLA performs in the U.S. stock market on different dates and times. You resolve to use your slicing and data visualisation skills to create a report to share with your team and receive feedback.

## Instructions

For this activity, you’ll use the Tesla stock data from an earlier activity. The first part of the starter Jupyter notebook recalls preparing the data and setting the time zone. Review the initial section, and then continue with the following steps:

1. Set the “time” column as the DataFrame index.

2. Plot the closing prices of the TSLA stock.

3. Using the `loc` function, zoom in to 2020 to inspect the TSLA closing prices.

4. Using the `loc` function, plot the closing prices from August and September 2020.

5. Using the `loc` function, plot the closing prices from August 22 and September 5, 2020.
