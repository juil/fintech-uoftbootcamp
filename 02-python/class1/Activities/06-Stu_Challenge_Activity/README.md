# Conditionally Yours, Part 2

In part two of this activity, you will use the pseudocode you created in the previous activity to develop a program that recommends purchasing or selling stock based on a percent increase or decrease of its stock price.

## Background

After hearing about your proposed pseudocode solution, Harold is ecstatic about actually coding out the finished program.

For this activity, work with a partner to code out the pseudocode solution of the previous activity:

* Implement the pseudocode in a Python file.

* Test the logic of the program with Netflix stock prices. 
   
    * Yesterday at 4:00 p.m., Netflix's stock price was $360.35. 
    
    * Right now, the stock price is $293.33.

* Calculate the percent increase using the formulas below, and then print a message to the screen indicating if the stock should be bought or sold.

  * Increase = Current Price - Original Price

  * Percent Increase = Increase / Original x 100

## Instructions

Using the [starter file](Unsolved/Core/conditionally_yours.py), complete the following steps:

1. Pseudocode your solution.

2. Create variables for the following:

    * `original_price`

    * `current_price`

    * `increase`

    * `percent_increase`

    * `recommendation`

    * `threshold_to_buy`

    * `threshold_to_purchase`

3. Derive `increase`.

4. Derive `percent_increase`.

5. Print `original_price`, `current_price`, and `percent_increase` to the screen with formatting.

6. Compare `percent_increase` to `threshold`.

7. Set `recommendation` to equal "buy" or "sell" based on your Step 5 evaluation.

8. Print `recommendation`.

## Challenge

Add a layer of sophistication to your program by creating a `balance` variable. This will serve as the amount of excess equity or money available in a portfolio.

Create logic that will take into consideration `balance` when determining a recommendation. Only recommend to buy if `balance` is five times the amount of the stock's current price.

## Hint

Use a [format specifier](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#format-specifiers) with the f-string.
