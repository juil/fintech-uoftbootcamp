# The Conditional Conundrum

In this activity, you will create a Python script that implements conditional statements using comparison and logical operators.

## Background

Like you, your coworker Sam is studying conditional statements. You two have decided to quiz each other on your ability to understand logical decision making. Sam has created a Python script with some conditional statements for your review. Follow the instructions below and complete Sam's quiz.

## Instructions

1. Open the [starter file](Unsolved/conditionals.py). Look through the examples and figure out what the output would be for each conditional statement.

2. Do not run the code yet; first see if you can follow the thought process and make a guess.

3. Once you've guessed, run the file.
