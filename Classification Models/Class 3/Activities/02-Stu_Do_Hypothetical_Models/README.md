# Hypothetical Models

In this activity, you will weigh the pros and cons of using each evaluation metric for a set of hypothetical classification models.

## Instructions

Working with a partner, review the following scenarios and think about what type of model you could create to predict the outcome of interest. Discuss what is being predicted, and which evaluation metrics would be the most productive for comparing the effectiveness of models.

1. A company wants to block phishing messages—predict whether an email is spam or not spam.

2. Doctors want an objective second opinion on imaging results—predict whether or not an MRI shows cancerous growth.

3. A study looks at gender differences in writing—predict whether a student is a boy or a girl based off their essays.

4. Improve weather forecasts—predict whether it will rain the next day.

5. A venture capital firm wants to optimize its investments—predict whether a company will undertake an IPO in the next 12 months.

## Hint

Think about the likelihood of each class, in addition to the costliness of false positives or negatives.
