## Predicting Diabetes

In this activity, you will use the Pima Diabetes dataset to train a logistic regression classifier to predict diabetes.

### Instructions

1. Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Separate the target (the `Outcome` column) from the features.

3. Split the data into training and testing data.

4. Create a logistic regression classifier model. Use the following parameters: `solver=lbfgs`, `max_iter=200`, `random_state=1`.

5. Fit the model to the training data.

6. Print the scores for the training and the testing data.

7. Use the testing data to make predictions and compare those to the actual testing data values.

### Hint

If you get stuck, refer back to the instructor demo notebook for examples of how to complete each step.
