## Turbo Boost

It's time to power up your decision tree machine-learning algorithm with a boosting algorithm. Using a boosting algorithm will result in a more robust algorithm, with a better ability to classify fraudulent transactions.

### Instructions

1. Open the starter file, and run the provided code.  Navigate to the Choose Optimal Learning Rate section. Choose the learning rate that produced the best model accuracy. Use this rate to build your own `GradientBoostingClassifier`.

2. Instantiate a `GradientBoostingClassifier` using the 100 `n_estimators`, the learning rate from step 1 as `learning_rate`, 5 `max_features`, `max_depth` of 3, and `random_state` of 0.

3. Use the `X_train_scaled` and `y_train` datasets, as well as the sklearn `fit` function, to fit the model. Note: Use the `ravel` function when using the `y_train` dataset. (Jasen: not necessary)

4. Score the model using the sklearn `score` function.

5. Use the `predict` function to make predictions.

6. Use the `accuracy_score` function to check the accuracy of the predictions. Hint: `accuracy_score (y_test, predictions)`.

7. Generate a confusion matrix and classification report.

8. Evaluate the model using the confusion matrix and classification report. Did the model perform as you expected? How did it execute compared to the other decision-tree algorithms?
