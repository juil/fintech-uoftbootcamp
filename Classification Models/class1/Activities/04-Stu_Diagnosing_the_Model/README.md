## Diagnosing the Model

In a previous activity, you created a logistic regression model to predict whether or not someone has diabetes. Using the `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report` functions provided by **sklearn**, you will evaluate that model and determine its accuracy and precision with an acceptable rate of false positives and false negatives. 

### Instructions

1. Generate the confusion matrix for the test data predictions.

2. Generate the classification report for the test data.

3. Interpret the results.

If time remains, discuss the results with a partner. How "good" is your predictor? Be prepared to share your model's diagnosis (the evaluation results) with the class!
